#  Business goal

*A “ghost kitchen” (food preparation and cooking facility set up for the preparation of delivery-only meals.) needs an ordering system to allow users to have visibility of what items are available, purchase, and pick up items at any one of their points of sale / smart-fridge.*


- Advising and managing health nutrition for an adult person (18-65 y.o.)
- Distribution channels:
  - Smart Fridges
- Two locations in Detroit to grow to 8 by 2021

### Internal Systems

- Smart Fridges: Smart-fridge is like a food/drink kiosks that you can mount everywhere; it’s connected to the company’s back-office. They have an independent system and API.
- Ghost Kitchen ordering system: Ghost kitchen back-office (https://pos.toasttab.com/) for managing food production.
- Point of sales: Not clear how currently it works, but it supports sales in PoS for not registered users.
  - The Kiosk is a sublet space inside another business where we will sell our product but have an employee handle the transactions through a point of sale. The same data should be accessible through the POS systems API’s
