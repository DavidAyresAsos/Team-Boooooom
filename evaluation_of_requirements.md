# Evaluation of Requirements

The initial brief of the Solution covered of many different requirements spread across a larger document. Below we call out the key requirements we have collated from the document and what we deem to be the deliverables for them with high level acceptance criteria.

## Primary Goals

The Primary Goals help ground the Solution Design to what the client ultimately wants and the top level business metrics the performance of the system would evaluated against. If we can't evidence how the Solution meets these goals, then as Architects we have failed the client.

1. [PG1] Develop relationships betweeen engaged customers and nurture those relationships.
2. [PG2] Convert transactional customers to engaged customers.
3. [PG3] Generate analytical data from medical informatio to demonstrate the benefits of Farmacy Foods.

These goals have been given reference values that will be used throughout the Solution Design to highlight how we ultimately tie back to these goals.

## Requirements

The Requirements have been tagged with a code in the same way the Primary Goals have to help highlight which parts of the Solution Design relates to them.

1. [RQ1] Add a new system to manage customer profiles, allowing community engagement, personalization around preferences and dietary needs
2. [RQ2] Support geographical trend analysis to hone Farmacy Familyâ€™s ability to optimize the foods delivered to fridges (an additional integration point TO Farmacy Foods)
3. [RQ3] Support both push and pull models for community engagement. In other words, Farmacy Family will manage forums,emails, and create connections between similar demographics. Farmacy Family needs transactional member information for outreach purposes. The engagement model includes subscriptions, forums, reference material, class information, and other media that supports Food-as-medicine
