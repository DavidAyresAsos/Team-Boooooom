# Evaluation of Requirements

The initial brief of the Solution covered of many different requirements spread across a larger document. Below we call out the key requirements we have collated from the document and what we deem to be the deliverables for them with high level acceptance criteria.

## Primary Goals

The Primary Goals help ground the Solution Design to what the client ultimately wants and the top level business metrics the performance of the system would evaluated against. If we can't evidence how the Solution meets these goals, then as Architects we have failed the client.

**[PG1]** Develop relationships betweeen engaged customers and nurture those relationships.

**[PG2]** Convert transactional customers to engaged customers.

**[PG3]** Generate analytical data from medical informatio to demonstrate the benefits of Farmacy Foods.

These goals have been given reference values that will be used throughout the Solution Design to highlight how we ultimately tie back to these goals.

## Requirements

The Requirements have been tagged with a code in the same way the Primary Goals have to help highlight which parts of the Solution Design relates to them.

**[RQ1]** Add a new system to manage customer profiles, allowing community engagement, personalization around preferences and dietary needs.

**[RQ2]** Support geographical trend analysis to hone Farmacy Familyâ€™s ability to optimize the foods delivered to fridges (an additional integration point TO Farmacy Foods).

**[RQ3]** Support both push and pull models for community engagement. In other words, Farmacy Family will manage forums,emails, and create connections between similar demographics. Farmacy Family needs transactional member information for outreach purposes. The engagement model includes subscriptions, forums, reference material, class information, and other media that supports Food-as-medicine.

**[RQ4]** eDietian has access customer profile to improve advice and monitoring of customers. Additionally, the customer and dietitian can interact via messages.

**[RQ5]** Farmacy Family wants to improve the distribution and potential food waste from having the wrong mix of foods in a particular fridge.

**[RQ6]** Farmacy Family will include medical profile information and the ability to share information with medical service providers.

**[RQ7]** Farmacy Family customers can customize how much profile information they want to allow the community to see, at a finegrained level.

**[RQ8]** Farmacy Family has relationships with third party providers (clinics, doctors, etc) that have access to more analytical data to improve engagement (for example, regional dietary observations).

**[RQ9]** Add Farmacy Family user interface to existing Foods interface, which is currently a Reactive monolith. Create a holistic UX for both food and Farmacy Family to support engagement model.

## Non-Functional Requirements

The Non-Functional Requirements are contained with the document but are called out more as footnotes. These need to be considered as part of the design, so are being listed here as NFRs. These don't follow the traditional design ethos of Performance, Thorugh-Put and Load due to the nature of the Kata.

**[NFR1]** The new system must seamlessly incorporate into Farmacy Foods.

*Design Approach:* Utilise assets that Farmacy Foods already has established, making them cross cutting technologies. Design with the assumption that changes to Farmacy Foods should be at a minimum and heavy lifting will sit within Farmacy Family. UX should have the same look and feel to the point where customers should be able to seamlessly transverse the applications without noticing they've moved between Farmacy Family and Farmacy Friends.

**[NFR2]** Improved use of analytics driven through the new integration of Farmacy Family will help gather new investors and prove better dietary outcomes in member communities.

*Design Approach:* This forms a concrete reporting requirement. We need to be able to evidence key metrics and undertsand the baseline data Farmacy Family will need to report on this.
