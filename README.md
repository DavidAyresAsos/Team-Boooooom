# Architectural Katas 2021 Autumn - Team-Boooooom

Dearest Judges,

Due to personal and professional circumstances Team Boooooom have regretably had to withdraw their entrance for the 2021 Autumn Katas.

We were unable to dedicate enough time to design and document a soluton to a quality that we would feel proud of.

We will make sure that we will be more than ready for the next challenge when it comes along.

We have [archived](https://github.com/DavidAyresAsos/Team-Boooooom/blob/main/evaluation_of_requirements.md) off what we were able to produce for future reference.

Kindest regards,

Devrin, Sertan Yamaner and David.
