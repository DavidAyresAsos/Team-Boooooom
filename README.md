# Architectural Katas 2021 Autumn - Team-Boooooom

Welcome to the Team Boooooom Architectural Katas 2021 Autumn submission. Our hope is to take the brief and put our own unique spin on the requirements to produce a forward thinking Architectural design that challenges the Business Stakeholders and Judges.

We are passionate about using technology to elegantly solve business problems in cost effective, scalable, cutting edge ways which delight our customers by delivering their requirements and more.

Our mantra leans more towards a Build what your core business value requires while Buying what others do better than you. There are many wonderful SaaS solutions that can enable rapid application development, there is often little to no value in reinventing the wheel.

While being passionate about Microservice and Event-Driven architectures, supported by message queue technology we aren't afraid to establish business processes where a purely technical solution isn't the most appropriate.

We hope you enjoy our approach and welcome any and all questions around our solution!
